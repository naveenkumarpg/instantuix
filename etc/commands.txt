"assemble": "^0.4.42"




One common cause of this error is that node_modules/assemble-handlebars doesn't contain a node_modules folder.

I'm not sure why, but sometimes node doesn't recursively install the modules for that folder.

A short term fix is to navigate to node_modules/assemble-handlebars in your terminal then run npm install.

cd node_modules/assemble-handlebars

npm install

Grunt should now run the assemble tasks without any error.
